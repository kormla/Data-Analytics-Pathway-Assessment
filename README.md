# Data-Analytics-Pathway-Assessment

In the banking sector, identifying clients who are likely to subscribe to term deposits is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies, improving customer targeting, and maximizing return on investment. This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on various features provided in the dataset.

The project will follow a structured approach:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies. This step will involve handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality through appropriate preprocessing techniques.

Feature Engineering – Evaluating the relevance of existing features and potentially creating new ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This may include encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and selecting the most influential predictors.

Building a Predictive Model – Implementing a suitable machine learning algorithm (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to classify clients based on their likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.

Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Given potential class imbalances, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights will be considered to improve model robustness.

Insights and Recommendations – Summarizing key findings from the analysis, highlighting the most impactful features, and providing actionable insights to help the marketing team refine their targeting strategies.
